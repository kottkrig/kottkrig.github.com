Android is an idea. A Very. Powerful. Idea.

With the Android project Google has set out to build an operating system that is as open as the web. You do not need to understand how the internet works, but rather just why it works. The web works because it is built on open standards. Everything from how servers talk to each other down to how Browsers render web pages.

It's absolutely in our, as the public's, interest to keep it that way. To ensure that the web remain free. 

What google has set out to do is ambitious. Google wants to build a system, to be used on everything from phones and tablets to tv:s. Envisioned to work in unison with the web.

This is what Android is. An idea of how to reach this vision through openness. An experiment if you so will, to build software based on the same fundamental principles that gave us the open web. Their beliefs are founded in the roots of other open projects that have succeeded throughout the years. Only by being open will we see true evolution and innoviation on every level of the computer sciences.

A lust for evolution and innovation that is greater than any one company. That is precisely what Android is. Greater than one company. Android is not just the vision of Google but a vision of an alliance of partners from a united industry.

Ideas are oblivious to the concept of ownership. Ideas should belong to everyone.
